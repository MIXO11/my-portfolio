                I am a technical support professional. I've always been interested in technology and computers, which led me to pursue a degree in BSIT. During my free time, I discovered a passion for coding and software development. When not working, I enjoy playing mobile games and exploring in programming. I hope to continue to grow and develop my skills as a software engineer and eventually become a successful programmer.
